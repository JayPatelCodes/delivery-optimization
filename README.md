## **Description**

This project utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve logistics optimization challenges. Users can configure parameters to change the optimization process and visualize how the AI evolves over multiple generations. The system focuses on optimizing delivery routes to reduce costs and travel time while maintaining user-defined constraints.

---

## **Features**

- Dynamically solves delivery routing problems.
- Tracks the AI's progress and improvements over generations.
- Allows users to adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and selection methods.
- Users can define delivery points, demands, and constraints.
